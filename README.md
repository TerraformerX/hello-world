# hello-world
This is just a repository I'm creating during the GitHub tutorial as I'm learning how to use the site.

I have a couple projects I have in mind right now.
1. I want to make a window manager I can use to make my own Mac OS 9-like desktop environment for Linux.
2. Software that can run on my homebrew 8088 computer. Previous programs that were 128 bytes or greater would crash once the CPU got to the instruction at address 128. Probably just a bug in my code.
